# Purity Toolbox
A toolbox for computing reference immutability (method purity and side-effects) summaries.

## Overview
This toolbox provides an Atlas native implementation of the context-sensitive method purity and side-effect analysis proposed in [ReIm & ReImInfer: Checking and Inference of Reference Immutability and Method Purity](https://huangw5.github.io/docs/oopsla12.pdf) and [ReImInfer: Method Purity Inference for Java](https://huangw5.github.io/docs/fse-tool12.pdf).
