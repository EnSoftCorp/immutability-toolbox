If you haven't already, [install](/immutability-toolbox/install) the Immutability Toolbox plugin into Eclipse.

First navigate to `Atlas Toolbox` &gt; `Edit Preferences` and confirm that `Run Immutability Analysis` is checked under the configuration options in the `Immutability Toolbox` submenu. Optionally select the base algorithm (points-to analysis or type inference) and configure any desired advanced options. Next Re-map the workspace by navigating to `Atlas` &gt; `Re-Map Workspace`. When the analysis is complete the results will be stored in the Atlas graph as tags and can be queried or viewed with the `Element Detail View`.
